Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

 - I'm currently a software engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/), working primarily on the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/), and have been working in the field since 2004.
 - I mostly write `/[TJ]S/`, but I'm [getting into Rust](https://clayto.com/tags/rust/).
 - I build a lot of Web Components for the [PatternFly Elements](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements) project.
 - I co-founded [Scripta Games](https://scripta.co/) with [Jared Sprague](https://github.com/jared-sprague), where we build video-games.
 - I co-host [Open Jam](https://openjam.io/), an annual game jam with open-source roots.
 - I enjoy building [art installations](http://kimotion.xyz/) and [other colorful things](https://clayto.com/demos/).

Here are the kinds of software I like to use, and to build:

 - I like fast software and I dislike slow software.
 - I like software that respects the user's freedom, privacy, and time.
